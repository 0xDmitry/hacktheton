This level walks you through the very basics of how to play the game.

# 1. Set up the wallet

If you don't have it already, install the TON wallet (e.g. [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/)) and connect.

# 2. Open the browser's console

Open your browser's console: `Tools > Developer Tools`.

You should see a few messages from the game.

Keep an eye out for warnings and errors, since they could provide important information during gameplay.

# 3. Use the console helpers

You can always see what other utility functions you have in the console, type:

`help()`

These will be super handy during gameplay.

# 4. Get testnet TON

To play the game, you will need testnet TON. Go to [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) and get your TON in the testnet.

# 5. Getting a level instance

When playing a level, you ask the game manager to generate a **level instance** for you. To do so, click the "GET NEW INSTANCE" button at the bottom of the page. Go do it now and come back!

You should be prompted by Tonkeeper to authorize the transaction. Note that this is deploying a new contract in the blockchain and might take a few seconds, so please be patient when requesting new level instances!

# 6. Inspecting the contract

You can inspect this contract's ABI through the console using the `contract` variable.

# 7. Interact with the contract to complete the level

Look into the level's info method `await contract.getInfo()`.
You should have all you need to complete the level within the contract.
To send a message to a contract, type:

`await contract.send(player, {value: toNano(0.05)}, "message")`

When you know you have completed the level, check the contract using the "CHECK SOLUTION" button at the bottom of the page.
This sends your instance back to the game manager, which will determine if you have completed it.
