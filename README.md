# Hack the TON

Hack the TON is a TON based wargame inspired by [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), to be played in the TON Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be hacked.

The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning TON security and development, and as a way to catalogue historical hacks as levels.

If you have an idea for a level or would like to contribute in any way, please contact me in [Telegram](https://t.me/dimtry0x) or [Twitter](https://x.com/0xDmitry)!
